Reporter
NPC
Excuse me, are you authorized to be here?
PickOption
(t:I'm a detective. I'm as authorized as you are. y:That's none of your business.)
NPC
Alright I'll believe ya. You look like one of them investigating types.
Hunter
Thanks, I think. I take it you're covering this case?
NPC
Yes sir, up and coming young reporter, that's me.
Hunter
Anything you can tell me about the victim?
NPC
There's not much dirt, unfortunately. He is said to be involved with some kind of underground market, but nobody knows if it's true or not.
Hunter
So it's just a rumor?
NPC
Yup. Otherwise he's just your typical businessman.
Hunter
Any reason why he lives in a hotel?
NPC
It's not like the guy was poor. The hotel says he always paid his fees on time too.
NPC
Apparently he kept to himself. Not many people saw him around. Pretty lackluster if you ask me.
Hunter
That in itself seems suspicious. What about when he was killed?
NPC
Well, he left one afternoon and didn't come back. 
NPC
Though the old man next door said he heard him talkin' on the phone with someone. Said something about meeting up about a deal, I think.
Hunter
Do you know where?
NPC
I'd assume it would be the place he was found dead, no? I'll be there later to snoop out anything juicy if I can find it. 
Hunter
That sounds like my next stop then.

I'm afraid it is my business as the dashing young reporter in charge.
Hunter
You don't seem like the in-charge type.
NPC
That's besides the point. If you continue this behavior, I shall have to ask you to leave.
Hunter
I'm just going to do a quick sweep of the room and I'll be on my way.
NPC
Alright, but don't cause any trouble. I have my eye on you.
Hunter
Since you want me out of here so fast, any advice on where to continue my investigation?
NPC
Have you tried the scene of the crime?
Hunter
That would be?
NPC
Far side of town. You know, where all the shops are. Are you really an investigator?
Hunter
That sounds like my next stop, thanks.
