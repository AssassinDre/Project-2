Older Lady
Hunter
Ma'am, I'd like to ask you some questions.
NPC
Is it about that murder case? People have been through here all afternoon asking.
Hunter
Yes, if you know anything, it would be a big help.
NPC
I see no reason to give you my story. I'm growing tired of repeating myself over and over.
Hunter
PickOption
(z: Please. I'm looking for someone. x:I'll make it worth your while.)
NPC
Looking for someone?
Hunter
A kid. I have reason to believe she's wrapped up in this.
NPC
... Hm. I suppose I could spare you the details.
Hunter
Please tell me what you know.
NPC
I more than know, as I've been telling reporter after reporter. 
NPC
I was walking past here on the day it happened.
Hunter
You're a witness?
NPC
So to speak. I never witnessed anything. Merely heard.
Hunter
Heard?
NPC
There were gunshots. Two, if I recall correctly. 
NPC
I made my way home as fast as I possibly could. I did not want to get myself in trouble.
Hunter
Gunshots... There was nothing else?
NPC
That is all. It came from the alley where the body was found.
Hunter
That could prove to be important. Thank you.
NPC
Of course, dear.

NPC
Worth my while? You are not one of those men too are you?
Hunter
I don't know what you're refering to.
NPC
Like the man who was killed. I hear he was involved with some nasty business.
NPC
People these days. They do not know how to make a decent living.
Hunter
You've seen such people before?
NPC
I've witnessed my fair share. 
NPC
Did you know the subways are crawling with them? It is despicable, honestly.
Hunter
Rest assured, I'm not involved with anything like that.
NPC
And rest assured, my suspicion remains.
Hunter
That's fine. I think I've got something I can work with.

Young Man
NPC
Hey, you. Are you one of those reporters?
Hunter
Me? No, I'm not.
NPC
That so? Good. I've been avoiding them all day. 
NPC
Finally stopped swarming the place to poke their noses some place else. 
Hunter
Sounds like you have something to hide.
NPC
No, it's not that. I just. There's this thing.
Hunter
Thing?
NPC
I found something, back in the alley where that man was found dead.
Hunter
Go on.
NPC
Here. Take it. I don't want to be holding this any longer. It's your problem now.
Hunter
A knife? You found this at the scene of the crime?
NPC
Yeah. A while back, before the police and reporters showed up. 
NPC
I've been holding on to it, but I couldn't work up the courage to turn it in. 
NPC
Do you think it's the murder weapon or something?
Hunter
Hm. There's an insignia on the blade.
NPC
That's partly what's got me so worried. This insignia belongs to one of the gangs in the area. 
NPC
Holdin' on to something like this means trouble.
Hunter
A gang symbol? You're sure?
NPC
Positive. I haven't seen much activity in the past few days, but it still puts me on edge.
Hunter
I haven't heard anything about their activity being on decline.
NPC
It's not on decline, but apparently there was an incident. Several members were hospitalized.
Hunter
Sounds like trouble broke out.
NPC
Something about one of the members starting a fight. 
NPC
I don't know what it was over, but chaos broke out.
NPC
I feel for that member, if they're not already dead. 
NPC
Being on the bad end of a stick like that means you only have so long to live.
Hunter
I hear you. I'll have to look into this more. Thanks for the tip.
