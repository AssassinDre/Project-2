Never gets old. The lack of info doesn't sit well with me, but it's worth it.
Hunter
This kid is supposedly involved with a gang and a murder. That's all I have to go off of for now.
Hunter
I guess I might as well take a look around here and see what I can find.

Bartend
What can I getcha hon?
Hunter
I'm looking for some information. Maybe you can help me.
Bartend
That'll depend on what it is you're askin' about.

(t:Can you tell me about gang activity around here? y:What can you tell me about the recent murder report?)
Bartend
Gangs huh? Don't know too much about that.
Bartend
Once and a while someone talks about someone getting killed. But I keep out of it.
Hunter
Ever talked to one of the members?
Bartend
Can't say that I have. Why the interest? You a cop or something?
Hunter
Look, if you don't have any info, I'll be on my way.
Bartend
Watch the attitude, honey. I can't tell you much else.
Bartend
But you might wanna snoop around the alley out back. The people who hang around there tend to be more in the know.
Hunter
I'll do that, thanks.

Bartend
Oh, you mean that man on the news? I heard he was involved in some black market dealing.
Bartend
Imagine. He seemed like a nice fellow too.
Hunter
You knew him?
Bartend
Not personally. He stopped in for a drink every now and again.
Bartend
Never stopped to talk to him though. Too many people are dyin' in this city.
Hunter
Anywhere I can find more info about him?
Bartend
I did hear him mention meeting somone in the alley around back a while ago.
Bartend
If you can find anyone there, they might give you something.
Hunter
Got it. Thanks for the tip.

Scruffy Man
Hunter
Excuse me, can I ask you some questions?
Scruffy
H-Huh? Are you a cop?
Hunter
PickOption
(t:Yeah, I'm a cop. y: No, I'm not. Just answer my questions.)
Scruffy
I'm sorry! I'll answer, I promise! 
Hunter
Do you know anything about the gangs in the area?
Scruffy
Gangs? N-No sir. 
Hunter
You're not lying to me? 
Scruffy
Of course not! I wouldn't lie, I swear! I stay far away from stuff like that. 
Hunter
And you wouldn't know where I can find someone who knows? 
Scruffy
No sir. 
Hunter
Useless punk.

Scruffy
You swear? 
Hunter
I swear. Now answer me. Do you know anything about gangs in this area? 
Scruffy
Gangs, sir? I'm not in any gangs. A buddy of mine used to be, but I wouldn't... 
Hunter
Go on. 
Scruffy
He's not with 'em any more! Said something about their rules being too strict. 
Scruffy
He didn't like the way they were operating. Something about it being too dangerous.
He was worried he'd get killed. 
Hunter
Did he tell you anything else? 
Scruffy
N-No sir. He wouldn't say. That's all I know, I'm sorry! 
Hunter
You can stop apologizing. That's all I wanted, go back to your drink.
