Kid
Hunter
  I am going to warn you now, there’s nowhere you can run.
NPC
You think I don’t know that. I wasn’t planning on it. 
Hunter
So what’s the story? I’ve heard plenty about you.
Hunter
Not all of it is bad. But not all of it’s good.
NPC
Aren’t you here to arrest me or something, not hear my life story?
Hunter
I like knowing why I take people in before I do. Besides, you don’t look like a killer to me.
NPC
Is that cause I’m young? Can’t imagine anyone who’s not an adult killing?
Hunter
Did you then?
NPC
Yeah, I did. That guy who was found dead in the alleyway. I did that. Happy?
Hunter
Not yet, no.
NPC
Than what else do you want?!
Hunter
Motive.
NPC
What? I’m supposed to think you’ll believe me.
Hunter
I might not. But think of what would happen if I did. 
NPC
There’s this gang. I’m sure you’ve heard about them. I’ve been with them for a while now.
NPC
They always treated me like dirt but it was a way to get money. Through little things. 
NPC
I’ve got my own people to take care of. And I can’t do it without those people.
NPC
They told me that if I took this guy out, I’d rise in the ranks. More control. Over them and over me.
Hunter
And things didn’t exactly go as planned.
NPC
Heh, you got that right. I went out hoping to make quick work of it, but the guy somehow knew I was coming.
NPC
I followed him to that alley and he pulled a gun on me. 
NPC
I barely had time to not get my brains blown out, so I panicked. 
NPC
I stabbed him and got out of there as fast as I could.
Hunter
So he shot at you and you stabbed him?
NPC
Yeah. And then I come back to the guys with blood on my hands and they’re waiting, but not to congratulate me.
Hunter
I hear you started a brawl.
NPC
They were completely ready to get rid of me. I had to fight my way out.
Hunter
And now you’re here?
NPC
That’s the gist of it. I don’t regret it. I’m not gonna let myself regret it.
NPC
But… I was an idiot, thinking I could finally get somewhere with this. 
NPC
But if I was to go back and do it again… 
NPC
I don’t care what happens to me.  
NPC
But my mom’s not gonna have anyone to take care of her. That kid won’t have anyone to play with him. 
NPC
It’s not like I did things without reason. 
Hunter
In the end, your actions are you own, you know that.
NPC
You can stand there and lecture me all day. But it’s not going to change anything.
NPC
Besides, you’re not here to do that.
Hunter
No, I’m not. 
Kid
Well then, do your thing, old man. I’ve got nowhere to run, right?
Hunter
Sounds like you’ve given up.
NPC
Huh?
Hunter
I think this case still merits more investigation. I haven’t tied up all the loose ends quite yet.
NPC
What? Isn’t that your job? I’m right here, isn’t that all there is?
Hunter
I’m a bounty hunter. But I think I’d like to consider myself an investigator, just this once. 
NPC
But. Why? 
Hunter
No reason. I’m a curious person. 
NPC
You’re putting yourself in danger, you know.
Hunter
I think I can take care of myself. 
NPC
Heh. You’re a weird old man. 
Hunter
I’ll take that as a compliment.
NPC
Thanks.
Hunter
Just doing my job.
