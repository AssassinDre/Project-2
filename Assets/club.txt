Hey there. Not many people come by here before the sun sets. What can I do for you?
Hunter
I'd like to ask some questions.
NPC
Alright, shoot. I got some time to spare.
PickOption
(t:About the kid in this picture... y:About the recent murder report...)
NPC
Oh. Isn't that the kid who was here the other day?
Hunter
You tell me.
NPC
I swear it was. We don't get a lot of children here. Didn't stay for too long though. She left with a middle aged gentleman who'd been here for a while."
Hunter
With a man?
NPC
If I remember correctly, yes. They had a pretty heated exchange and then left. Couldn't tell you what they were talking about though. They were out of earshot.
Hunter
I see. Apparently this kid is involved with the local gangs. I wonder if it has something to do with it.
NPC
Huh, if they're involved, then it's no wonder things are messy.
Hunter
Do you have something against them?
NPC
Nothing good comes of people like that. If that kid was involved, I feel bad for the man who left with her.
NPC
There's no trusting those people. They'll slit your throat when you're not looking.
Hunter
Aren't you going a bit far?
NPC
Ain't nothing happened to prove me wrong. I'd stay far away from gang activity if I were you.
Hunter
I'm afraid that's not an option. I go where the information leades me.
NPC
Well if you're lookin', try the streets downtown. I hear there was a murder around there recently. 
NPC
You might find some worthy sources of info. Don't say I didn't warn you though.

NPC
Murder? Oh, you mean that case that's been on the news lately? I couldn't tell you much 'bout that.
Hunter
You've never seen him before?
NPC
People come in and out of here all the time. There comes a point when it's difficult to tell them apart.
Hunter
You must have noticed something strange within the past week.
NPC
Hmm When you put it that way, there was something. A man was here a few days ago. He caused a little stir. 
NPC
What I've heard is that he had an argument with someone over money matters. One of them refused to cough up the dough. My boss had to step in and calm them down.
Hunter
Do you remember who this man was or who he was arguing with?
NPC
They both looked like someone you wouldn't want to get on the bad side of. And one of them was much younger, I think.
Hunter
Anything else?
NPC
Not that I can remember. Hey, if you'relooking for leads on this murder thing, why don't you check the scene of the crime?
Hunter
That was the plan.
NPC
Just be careful. Don't say I didn't warn you.
