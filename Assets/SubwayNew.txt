Dealer
NPC
Hello there handsome. Beautiful evening, isn’t it?
Hunter
I know your type, don’t act innocent with me.
NPC
My, my, someone is forward. 
NPC
Well then, I’ll cut to the chase. What services may I provide for you tonight?
Hunter
I’m in need of information. 
NPC
Is that all? Whatever for?
Hunter
Does this ring any bells? I found it lying in the garbage in an alley.
NPC
You must be looking into the unfortunate man whose death is all over the news these days. 
Hunter
Actually I’m looking into the person who killed him.
NPC
Oh? You found his killer? My, that was quick of you.
Hunter
Do you know something you’re not telling me?
NPC
A few things. I suppose since the sap’s gone and gotten himself dead, it won’t hurt to tell.
NPC
The substances in that syringe are one of many things that the man who died helped us with.
NPC
He was our top seller, so it’s a little unfortunate to see him go, if you know what I mean.
NPC
He managed to strike it big with the leader of one of the local gangs. 
NPC
They had quite the partnership for some time
Hunter
Until?
NPC
Until the prices of products went up and the children didn’t want to pay. 
NPC
He knew they would come after him  so he prepared a pistol and a small case of bullets. 
NPC
But I must say that I did not expect things to turn out as they did. 
Hunter
For self defense?
NPC
Oh, no. He was never the self-defense sort. Quite the opposite.
Hunter
Point taken. Do you know any circumstances surrounding his death?
NPC
I wasn’t there of course..
NPC
But my sources tell me that somewhere there’s a young person holed up somewhere.
NPC
She might not be entirely innocent, nor entirely guilty.
Hunter
You know the location?
NPC
Try your luck with the abandoned buildings on the far side of town, dear. 
NPC
You might find something interesting

I’m in need of information. 
NPC
Is that all? Whatever for?
Hunter
I’m looking into someone potentially involved with a murder case.
NPC
Ah, that case. I know the one.
Hunter
You’ll be able to tell me something then.
NPC
Well, I suppose I know a little. 
NPC
The poor fellow who died was someone I’d been doing business with for a long time. 
NPC
It’s a shame he had to go, but I can’t say he didn’t have it coming for him. 
NPC
Always had his nose in the wrong people’s business, profitable though they were. 
Hunter
Do you know anything about the way he died?
NPC
Who can say if you weren’t there. I hear plenty of people had it out for him. 
NPC
But he wasn’t the type to let himself be targeted first. 
Hunter
Point taken. 
NPC
Now, I’m not entirely uninvolved, so I’ll tell you this. 
NPC
My sources tell me that there’s a young person holed up somewhere. 
NPC
Try your luck on the abandoned buildings on the far side of town, dear.
