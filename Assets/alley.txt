NPC
Hey, what are you doing wandering around here? This isn't a place for normal people!
Hunter
Me? This is no place for kids to be hanging about.
NPC
Hah! I'm not a kid, you don't have to worry about me.
Hunter
Normally, I'd be concerned if I wasn't in the middle of an investigation.
NPC
Investigation?! That's so cool! Are you a detective mister? Do you have a badge? And a real gun? Can I see it?
Hunter
Calm down, I'm not showing you my gun. But I'll show you this. Do you know the kid in this picture?
NPC
Hey! Where'd you get that?!
Hunter
That's the person I'm investigating.
NPC
That's a piture of my friend!
Hunter
Your what? You know this kid?
NPC
Of Course! We usually play here every day... But I haven't seen her since last week. Do you know what happened, mister?
Hunter
Did your friend say anything weird to you last week?
NPC
Just that she was going to bring me something special because she was going to prove herself. She was going to get a special tattoo.
Hunter
A tattoo huh?
NPC
Yeah, the strong members of all the gangs have one.
Hunter
Did she say how she was going to get this tattoo?
NPC
I asked, but she wouldn't tell me. She talked about the club down the street, but that's it. Are you going to find my friend? She didn't do anything bad, right?
Hunter

(t: We don't know for sure. y: I'm sure she's fine.)
Hunter
It's likely your friend is involved with something very bad, kid.
NPC
No, she'd never! She's a good person. She takes care of her mom. And plays with me. She's really strong!
Hunter
Good or not, it's not for me to decide.

Angry Girl
Hunter
Excuse me, I'd like to ask you some questions.
NPC
Huh? Who the hell are you? Reporter?
Hunter
Something like that. Now if you-
NPC
Ugh, stay away from me, creep. I don't have to answer your questions.
Hunter
I don't think I have anything I can use to convince her to talk to me...

Girl
Hunter
Excuse me, I'd like to ask you some questions.
NPC
Huh? Who the hell are you? Reporter?
Hunter
Something like that. I want to know if you know anything about this newspaper article.
NPC
That's- I mean, I don't know anything about that article.
Hunter
Oh? And I assume you know nothing about the man who died either.
NPC
Nope. Never heard of him in my life.
PickOption
(t: I see. Sorry to bother you. y: That's a shame, isn't it?)
NPC
Right, no problem.

Hunter
The guy probably deserved what he got in the end anyways. But it's not my problem.
NPC
He did not!
Hunter
No?
NPC
I mean. Arg, fine! I know the guy... Knew the guy, ok. Are you happy?
Hunter
Not until you tell me more.
NPC
We got along. He took me places, paid for dinner. Told me about his work, selling things to people, real important people. He was real cool like that.
Hunter
PickOption
(t:Were you dating or something? y:Did you go anywhere else with the guy?)
NPC
Are you out of your mind?
Hunter
I'm just asking.
NPC
That's private. Although, he did let me stay over in his hotel room sometimes. I think he lived there, I swear. 
Hunter
Where is this hotel?
NPC
Hey, are you... going to find the person who killed him? Bring them to justice and all that?
Hunter
If that's what's at the end of my search, then yes.
NPC
Here, I'll give you this, it's the address to his hotel room. I'm sure it's open for people like you to investigate.
Hunter
Thanks, it's appreciated.

NPC
Besides resteraunts? We took walks through the streets sometimes. And he let me stay at his hotel a few times when I was too tipsy to go home myself.
NPC
I think he lived in that hotel room. Makes me kind of sad thiking we won't be going back there anymore.
Hunter
This hotel, where is it?
NPC
Hey, are you... going to find the person who killed him? You're a reporter or something like that right?
Hunter
If that's what's at the end of my search, then yes.
NPC
Here, I'll give you this, it's the address to his hotel room. I'm sure it's open for people like you to investigate.
Hunter
