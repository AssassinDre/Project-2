Hospital
Gang Member
NPC
Yeah, you called for me? What you want?
Hunter
I’m here to ask about one of your members. There’s someone who went missing not too long ago.
NPC
Oh. The hell you want with the kid? Find where she’s gone off to?
Hunter
It’s my job to find out. I was hoping you could point me in the right direction.
NPC
Remind me  why I’d want to help you.
Hunter
Because it seems like your gang has a problem with this kid, am I wrong?
NPC
Heh. Naw you’re on the money there old man. 
Hunter 
So, what’s the story?
Member
You really wanna know? There’s this man, see? He was doin’ business with us for some odd years.
NPC
But recently things have been, how would you say? Rocky. Between us. 
NPC
He wanted more than was due to him. Bit off more than he could chew. 
NPC
And hell, we’re all street trash tryin’ to scrape by. 
NPC
You’re dead wrong if you think we’re going to pawn off our livelihood to some scum just cause he gets a little greedy.
Hunter
So where does the kid come into the picture with all this?
NPC
We wanted the dude out of our hair. That kid was looking for something to make her name known. 
NPC
I told her she could take any extra cash she could find in his pockets. Give it to that sick mum of hers.  
NPC
Heck, you should have seen her eyes sparkle when I finally agreed to let her do it. 
Hunter
You sent in some kid as a hitman to take out someone you didn’t like?
NPC
Hey, man, she came beggin’ to me. Had a knife prepared and everything. 
NPC
Said it was the only way she could get by. How could I refuse that?
Hunter
And then? She didn’t agree with you afterwards?
NPC
Hah. Freakin’ ungrateful leech wanted to take everything. She was going to rat us out even. Pin the blame on me and my boys and get away scott free. 
NPC
We tried to reason with her, but she wouldn’t have it. 
NPC
We got into a scuffle  that turned into a brawl and lets just say not all of us got out without scratches. 
Hunter
No idea where she is now?
Member
Probably hidin’ out in some abandoned building. I heard she sleeps there. 
NPC
I wish I was out of this damn hospital so I could look for her myself.
Hunter
You leave that to me. Thanks for the tip.
