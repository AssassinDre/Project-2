You've received the mission correspondence?
Hunter
Yeah. It's the kid in the photo this time, right?
NPC
Correct. That "kid" is a high priority for the company.
Hunter
Because you think this kid is connected to that murder case?
NPC
This disappearance has since crossed the line of coincidence, I think you know. 
NPC
I trust that we can rely on your efficient tracking skills.
Hunter
Have I ever let you down before?
NPC
Good to hear. Take a look around. 
NPC
The people in those parts of the city may know something important.
Hunter
You're sure there's nothing else you can give me?
NPC
I'm afraid policy prevents that. 
NPC
But judging by the price tag, I'm sure there will be no problems.
Hunter
Yeah, I'll do it. Finding one kid shouldn't be too hard. 
NPC
Good. We will contact give you further instructions when you have located the target.
