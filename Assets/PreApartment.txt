We've tracked your location. You say you've found the target?
Hunter
Yeah, this should be the place.
NPC
Good. When you have the target in your sights, you are to immediately dispose of it.
Hunter
What?
NPC
This is a direct order. You carry a gun for a reason.
Hunter

NPC
Your job is to locate, not to make moral judgements.
NPC
Refusal is not an option. Your own safety and the stability of this company rests with you.
Hunter
... I understand.
NPC
Very good. I will check back in when you have completed this task.
