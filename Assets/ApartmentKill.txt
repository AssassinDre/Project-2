Kid
Hunter
  I am going to warn you now, there’s nowhere you can run.
NPC
You think I don’t know that. I wasn’t planning on it.
Hunter
So what’s the story? I’ve heard plenty about you.
Hunter
Not all of it is bad. But not all of it’s good.
NPC
Aren’t you here to arrest me or something, not hear my life story?
Hunter
I like knowing why I take people in before I do. I want to know if you’re really a killer.
NPC
Is that cause I’m young? Can’t imagine anyone who’s not an adult killing?
Hunter
Did you then?
NPC
Yeah, I did. That guy who was found dead in the alleyway. I did that. Happy?
Hunter
Not yet, no.
NPC
Than what else do you want?!
Hunter
Motive.
NPC
What? I’m supposed to think you’ll believe me.
Hunter
I might.
NPC
There's this gang. I've been with 'em for several years, even if they all treat me like dirt.
NPC
Its a way to get money. Robbery. Trading things that stay under the radar. 
NPC
They told me this time I’d rise in the ranks. All I had to do was take this guy out.
NPC
You know, tattoos are a sign of power where I come from. If you have certain ones, you’re allowed things others aren’t.
NPC
I’ve always wanted that and this was supposed to be my chance.
Hunter: Not everything went according to plan. 
NPC
Hah, you got that right. The guy was ready for me. He’s one of those always prepared types.
NPC
I guess he’s been in the business for a while so it’s not unexpected. 
NPC
I followed him into the alley and he pulled a gun on me. I barely managed to not get my head blown off before I managed to stab him. 
Hunter
So he shot at you, then you stabbed him?
NPC
Yeah. I grabbed his gun afterwards and made sure he was dead. 
NPC
But then I got out of there as fast as I could. I don’t know what happened to my knife. 
Hunter
And when you got back, things didn’t go so well either?
NPC
They’d planned to turn on me the entire time. They wanted to let their little grunt do all the work and then take the fall. 
NPC
I wasn’t prepared to let that happen. So a fight broke out, I escaped, and now I’m here. 
NPC
I don’t regret it you know. Well, I regret that I wasn’t able to see I was being tricked. 
NPC
Then maybe things would have been a little different. 
NPC
I was an idiot thinking I could finally get somewhere. 
Hunter
In the end, your actions are your own. You only have yourself to blame. 
NPC
Don’t lecture me. You think I don’t know that?
Hunter
I’m sorry it had to end this way.
NPC
I’m sorry too, believe me. When I’m sitting behind bars, I will be too.
NPC
But it’s your job isn’t it? You don’t get to feel bad.
Hunter
No, I really am sorry. 
NPC
What?-
End
